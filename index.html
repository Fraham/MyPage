      <h4>My Second Year Project - EasyLiving</h4>
      <p>For my second group project we were left to come up with our own ideas to produce any type system we wanted. We finalised on a room monitoring system which collects enivormental information from different areas in the house.
As a group we decided to use PHP on the backend server and jQuery for frontend development. We felt these were the best choices available as they both lots of online tutorials and resources. We also used the Bootstrap framework which allowed us to build a website with one codebase while providing access from desktops down to mobile with its ability of using the correct element widths for the screen size. The idea behind the project was to provide people the ability to monitor a set of rooms from any device with an internet connections so we built the website with the focus of mobile first then working on larger screen sizes.
The initial site I was able to retrieve the data from our MySQL database then package the data using PHP into a JSON object which is sent to the page where I was able to set up client rendering of the data. This would give us all the data we needed in the right format but wouldnâ€™t update when the sensors collected new data. I was able to setup a GET request system so I could call the server asking for new data to be displayed through a set interval function which later developed into a long poll request. In my current third year group project we are using web sockets with a ruby on rails backend.
