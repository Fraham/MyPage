      <h4>My Second Year Project - EasyLiving</h4>
      <p>For my second group project we were left to come up with our own ideas to produce any type system we wanted. We finalised on a room monitoring system which collects enivormental information from different areas in the house.
As a group we decided to use PHP on the backend server and jQuery for frontend development. We felt these were the best choices available as they both lots of online tutorials and resources. We also used the Bootstrap framework which allowed us to build a website with one codebase while providing access from desktops down to mobile with its ability of using the correct element widths for the screen size. The idea behind the project was to provide people the ability to monitor a set of rooms from any device with an internet connections so we built the website with the focus of mobile first then working on larger screen sizes.
The initial site I was able to retrieve the data from our MySQL database then package the data using PHP into a JSON object which is sent to the page where I was able to set up client rendering of the data. This would give us all the data we needed in the right format but wouldn’t update when the sensors collected new data. I was able to setup a GET request system so I could call the server asking for new data to be displayed through a set interval function which later developed into a long poll request. In my current third year group project we are using web sockets with a ruby on rails backend.

<h4>My Third Year Project - EasyLiving2</h4>
<p>As my course is software engineering branch of computer science I have to complete big group project which is equates to a quarter of my final grade. The course has been designed to give us a similar experience of developing software as we would be doing in industry. We use agile development to help us produce our system with having a weekly system release and a scrum meeting everyday helps to try and emulate the situation we would expect in the future. The course encourages us to work as a team, making sure that each member understand what is happening in the system while also introducing new techniques like pair programming.
</p>
<p>I am developing the hardware which are Sun Microsystems Sun SPOTS. They use a base station connected to a computer through a USB cable with the actual SPOTS being able to transmit sensor data to the base station using radio waves.
One of the requirements for the project is to connect EasyBulb lights into the system to be able to change the colour of the bulb from a remote location. The bulbs can connect to the local wireless network and can receive commands from a mobile app or an infrared controller. The problem I had was that the API provided from EasyBulb wasn’t up-to-date which meant the data being sent to the bulb would not change the characteristics which were desired. After doing some research on other project people have made for the bulbs I was able to find a desktop application which could control the bulbs.
Using the application with wireshark I was able to see all the packets of data being sent to the bulb. I was able to see a pattern in the transmissions as each new instruction would send out two packets which I deduced was one for turning on the bulb and the other being the control packet. This also helped me with finding out the port number and http headers I needed. After doing some more research I found an implementation of the bulb system written in PHP. The PHP had all the commands for the bulb so I just had to port the code over to Java and was able to get all the functionality working.
I was then able to fit the new system into the current system architecture and test the bulb responded correctly to the commands of the user.
